We note various conceptual and methodological problems in the ways these arguments have been advanced, and stress in particular the importance of maintaining the Weberian distinction between class and status. We concentrate on musical consumption and apply latent class models to identify types of musical consumer. We then examine the social character of these types through a regression analysis that includes a range of demographic and stratification variables. As would be anticipated from a Weberian standpoint, type of musical consumption proves to be more closely associated with status, and also with education, than with class. In general, our results provide little support for the homology or individualisation arguments. They are more consonant with the omnivore–univore argument, although a number of qualifications to this are also suggested.},

  abstract  = {In this article, we return to Max Weber's distinction between class and status as related but different forms of social stratification. We argue that this distinction is not only conceptually cogent, but empirically important as well. Indeed, class and status do have distinct explanatory power when it comes to studying varying areas of social life. Consistent with Weber's assertions, we show that economic security and prospects are stratified more by class than by status, while the opposite is true for outcomes in the domain of cultural consumption. Within politics, class rather than status predicts Conservative versus Labour Party voting in British general elections and also Left-Right political attitudes. But it is status rather than class that predicts Libertarian-Authoritarian attitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {It has become fashionable to argue that stratification is taking on an increasingly 'postmodern' form, as participation in lifestyles or communities becomes a function of individual taste, choice, and commitment rather than a direct reflection of class membership. Although postmodernism of this sort has become popular in some circles, relevant empirical analyses are few and far between and have inevitably been carried out at a highly aggregate level, thereby muting or obscuring the local subcultures that are generated at the more detailed occupational level. The great failing, then, of conventional quantitative analyses of 'class effects' is that gemeinschaftlich occupations are regarded as nominal categories and are therefore blithely aggregated or dimensionalized. If analyses are instead ratcheted down to the disaggregate level of detailed occupations, the effects of class may become sufficiently strong to cast doubt on the postmodernist retreat from production-based groupings.

  abstract  = {Recent inequality scholarship fixates on trends in the amount of inequality and largely ignores trends in the form of inequality. The authors describe three ideal-typical inequality regimes (big-class, microclass, and gradational) and identify the mechanisms driving a shift toward or away from each of them. Using GSS and CPS data on 39 measures of life chances, attitudes, and behaviors, the authors find that big-class inequality is in decline whereas microclass inequality has remained stable. Moreover, big classes are simplifying into largely economic aggregates, whereas microclasses remain more complicated moral configurations that cannot be understood in terms of economic standing.

  abstract  = {Three of the five major concerns of class analysts over time are completely neglected by Grusky and Weeden. With respect to the two others, a substitution of their research agenda for existent kinds of research is more likely to impoverish than to enrich our knowledge. A supplement of penetrating occupational studies, on the other hand, would be a welcome addition. The most promising research agenda for scholars interested in class, it seems to me, is to take a direction opposite to local occupational shrinking. That is, into comparative studies, across the periods and the continents of the modern era, of class and non-class discursive and political strategies and cultural receptions, and into investigations of the interfaces of national socio-economic cleavages, institutions and distributive processes, on the one hand, and global or transnational flows, entanglements, and historical preconditioning, on the other.

  abstract  = {Social changes associated with late modernity have led many to question the continuing relevance of class analysis. This paper shows that, far from being dead, class remains an important analytical tool. This is shown in relation to the constitution of economic classes, the causal effects of class situations, the formation of social classes, and patterns of class awareness. It is argued that economic class divisions can still be identified and that they continue to exercise a major impact on life chances. Nevertheless, class effects must be considered alongside other, partially offsetting, causal effects, and this means that patterns of social class formation are looser than in the past. People continue to recognise the existence of economic and social class divisions, but they are likely to supplement this with other lifestyle factors in constituting their social identities.

  abstract  = {This study uses a sample of 982 Australian workplaces to ascertain whether labor segmentation affects the Australian economy. Cluster analysis allocates private-sector workplaces among the primary independent, primary subordinate and secondary segments. I then test whether segment location predicts other facets of the workplace, and whether the two primary segments significantly diverge. The majority of such tests overwhelmingly support the argument that the hypothesized segments exist and help explain the functioning of workplaces. The evidence also suggests that various divide-and-conquer strategies are often applied by Australian firms to reduce worker solidarity and that conditions for employees in the primary segments have recently deteriorated while innovative employee relations techniques have simultaneously emerged.

Segmentation theories are not supported by the high covariability of wage rates supported by this test. If segmentation theories are to mean more than that relative wages differ among industries, proponents of such theories must argue that segmented markets are cut off from other markets and able to resist the forces of supply and demand. Indeed if labor unions are to be able to insulate workers from market forces they must also segment their markets. The results of this paper indicate that unions are not able to insulate their workers from market forces.},

The distribution of employment over the period 1973-90 shifted sharply away from the two middle-quality contours toward the two highest-quality contours. The two lowest-quality contours show no decline in employment share in the 1980s. The declining relative position of employed black and Hispanic men stems from both a worsening job mix relative to white men and a sharp drop in the quality of low-skill jobs. Female workers experienced both a greater shift away from jobs in the lower-quality contours and higher real earnings growth within each job contour than male workers.},

By allowing the distribution of wages and worker attributes to identify the assignment of workers to sectors, the problems of arbitrariness and sample selection bias that complicate the interpretation of previous research were avoided.},

  abstract  = {Over the last 30 years, trends such as service sector growth, welfare state expansion \& rising female participation rates have promoted increasing heterogeneity within the occupational system. Accordingly, this article argues that the class map has to be redrawn in order to grasp these changes in the employment structure. For that purpose, it develops the bases of a new class schema that partly shifts its focus from hierarchical divisions to horizontal cleavages. The middle class is not conceptualized as a unitary grouping \& the manual/non-manual divide is not used as a decisive class boundary. Instead, emphasis is put on differences in marketable skills \& the work logic. The schema is expected to more accurately reflect the class location of unskilled service employees \& to make visible the political divide within the salaried middle class. This expectation is empirically examined with survey data from Britain, Germany, Sweden \& Switzerland. Findings for earnings \& promotion prospects indicate that the schema successfully captures the hierarchical dimension in the class structure. Moreover, results for party support \& union membership suggest that the schema grasps a salient horizontal cleavage between managers \& sociocultural professionals.

The second part then makes the case for the continuing relevance of class analysis, in our conception of it, by reviewing findings from three central areas of current research.},
