  Abstract                 = {This article explores the link between violence and public discourse. It suggests that media attention to radical right violence and public reactions to violence affect the clustering of targets and the temporal and spatial distribution of violence. The notion of âdiscursive opportunitiesâ is introduced, and the article argues that it can serve to link political opportunity structure and framing perspectives on collective action. Using a crossâsectional and timeâseries design to model event counts in states in Germany, this study finds that differential public visibility, resonance, and legitimacy of rightâwing violence significantly affected the rate of violence against different target groups.},

  Abstract                 = {The essay develops two interrelated arguments. The first argument brings into play the concepts of globalization, democracy and social movements, and underlines their mutually constitutive character in the development of Western societies since the 18th century. The second argument points to an uncertain future by looking at a confusing present. Extrapolating from the analysis of the historical relationship between globalization, democracy and social movements, it identifies the incipient development of a global solidarity position. This position is anchored in radical democratic ideas and expressed by contemporary social movement networks whose activities involve the crossing of physical, social and cultural distances. The emphasis on radical democracy and the decidedly global nature of the position implies a challenge to the traditional national and state anchored conception of democracy and its liberal and representative foundations. Theoretically, the article draws from a number of currents in the social movements and globalization literatures.},

  Abstract                 = {Although social movement studies have traditionally stressed conflict as a dynamic element in our societies, since the 1980s, research in democratic society has presented an image of an institutionalization of social movements. Since 1999, with the protest in Seattle against the {WTO} Millennium Round, this image has been however challenged by a new cycle of protest focusing on âalternative globalizationâ and global justice. Beyond describing some forms of action that (through counter-summits and social forums) emerged in this cycle of protest, the article addresses the more general issue of conflict nowadays by considering the emergent character of protest itself. In social movement studies, protest has in fact been mainly considered as a âdependent variableâ, and explained on the basis of political opportunities and organizational resources. The author suggests here a different approach, by looking at protests as eventful, in the sense of having relevant cognitive, affective and relational transformative impacts on the very movements that carry them out. Some forms of action or specific campaigns have a particularly high degree of âeventfulnessâ. Through protest events, new tactics are experimented with, signals {aBolit} the possibility of collective action are sent, feelings of solidarity are created, organizational networks are consolidated, and sometimes public outrage at repression is developed. Data from interviews, surveys, focus groups and discourse analysis are used in order to reflect upon the mechanisms that make protest eventful. More in general, the article suggests that the contemporary sociological reflection on conflicts as producers of social capital, collective identity and knowledge, could be useful to balance the negative vision of conflicts as being disruptive of social relations, an analysis that can emerge from an exclusive focus on the most extreme forms of political violence.},

  Abstract                 = {This article aims to explain the emergence of the Danish People's Party, a radical right-wing populist party, by using a model combining political opportunity structures and the diffusion of new master frames. The article shows that because of dealignment and realignment processes â as well as the politicisation of the immigration issue â niches were created on the electoral arena. The Danish People's Party was able to mine these niches by adopting a master frame combining ethno-pluralist xenophobia and anti-political establishment populism, which had proved itself successful elsewhere in Western Europe (originally in France in the mid-1980s). In this process of adaptation, a far right circle of intellectuals, the Danish Association, played a key role as mediator.},

  Abstract                 = {The social scientific analysis of social class is attracting renewed interest given the accentuation of economic and social inequalities throughout the world. The most widely validated measure of social class, the Nuffield class schema, developed in the 1970s, was codified in the {UK}’s National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification ({NS}-{SEC}) and places people in one of seven main classes according to their occupation and employment status. This principally distinguishes between people working in routine or semi-routine occupations employed on a ‘labour contract’ on the one hand, and those working in professional or managerial occupations employed on a ‘service contract’ on the other. However, this occupationally based class schema does not effectively capture the role of social and cultural processes in generating class divisions. We analyse the largest survey of social class ever conducted in the {UK}, the {BBC}’s 2011 Great British Class Survey, with 161,400 web respondents, as well as a nationally representative sample survey, which includes unusually detailed questions asked on social, cultural and economic capital. Using latent class analysis on these variables, we derive seven classes. We demonstrate the existence of an ‘elite’, whose wealth separates them from an established middle class, as well as a class of technical experts and a class of ‘new affluent’ workers. We also show that at the lower levels of the class structure, alongside an ageing traditional working class, there is a ‘precariat’ characterised by very low levels of capital, and a group of emergent service workers. We think that this new seven class model recognises both social polarisation in British society and class fragmentation in its middle layers, and will attract enormous interest from a wide social scientific community in offering an up-to-date multi-dimensional model of social class.},

  Abstract                 = {Common explanations of terrorism, here illustrated by the work of Jessica Stern and of {US} State Department analysts, have two significant weaknesses. First, they homogenize terror, assuming that one type of person, group, or action accounts for most instances of its use. Second, they focus on dispositions and motives, decision logics, emotions, or cultural templates of terror-producing actors prior to their action. Adequate explanations of terror must repair these defects by a) looking systematically at variation among producers of terror and b) shifting the focus to relations among actors. Terror is a strategy employed by a wide variety of persons and groups, involving a substantial range of actions.},

  Abstract                 = {This article examines the complex relationship between political agency, responsibility, and collective violence in connection with political protest. Contemporary Danish and Swedish left-wing activist narratives of police provocations at political protest events are analysed to clarify how provocation and its relation to the outbreak of violence are retrospectively constructed in radical milieus. Three âprovocation plotsâ are identified that, respectively, present (1) the interaction as purely a matter of attack and defence, (2) provocation as a cause of anger leading to retaliation, and (3) provocation as a trigger bringing about a redefinition of the situation that then offers an opportunity for violence. Subsequent negotiations among political activists regarding the position of moral high ground revolved around the issue of whether responding to the provocation in each of these cases meant taking or losing control of the situation. Internet discussion forums are highlighted as important arenas for debates among members of protest coalitions and in broader social movement milieus in which the interpretation of protest events and their implications for future protest tactics is negotiated. In the cases considered, storytelling after violent events was used to make sense of, and evaluate, often quite chaotic and ambiguous processes of violent confrontation, suggesting itself as a key to understanding the micro-dynamics of how social movement repertoires of action are maintained and developed.},

  Abstract                 = {The first part of this article argues that the recent emergence of rightâwing political parties in Western Europe do not constitute either a return to fascism, a new form of extremism, or simply a new incarnation of populism, nor can its reappearance be explained by the ânew values/old valuesâ approach of the postâmaterialist school. Instead, it proposes that it is more accurate to refer to the emergence of rightâwing parties as radical right populism. The second part of the article argues that radical right populist parties have a specific party organisational structure, mobilising tactics, and a specific ideology. Radical right populist parties combine charismatic leadership, a populist discourse and a hierarchical party structure with the ability of the organisations to penetrate and mobilise disenfranchised and alienated voters within civil society. They employ an antiâstate, antiâbureaucratic, antiâelite, antiâEuropean Union political message. This message is coupled with the scapegoating of immigrants and âoutsiders.â And finally, radical right populist parties paradoxically support a freeâmarket economy, while opposing economic and cultural globalisation.},
